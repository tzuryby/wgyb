====

Are you a female (or a male, or genderqueer, or a member of an underrepresented demographic in tech)* who is scared to join the tech industry? Don't be; we've got your back:

*To be clear, we don't think that you are scared to join the tech industry because you are scared of technology. Learning to code is often frustrating for ALL beginners, and you have to be persistent and stop thinking yourself an idiot -- even when you have 'duh' moments and make lots of small mistakes. Everyone goes through that.
